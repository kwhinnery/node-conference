# Twilio Conference Boilerplate

Thanks for checking out the Twilio Conference Boilerplate!  Before you can start using this app, there's a bit of configuration that needs to happen first.  In the BlueMix admin console, you must create a new Twilio service and name it "twilio".  Then, you must associate that service with this application in the BlueMix console.

After that, you should be all set!  Visit the root URL of the app to create a shareable ad-hoc conference call, where everyone can join in from their browser.
